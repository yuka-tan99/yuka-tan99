1. Compile in the following order: Item.java, Pet.java, 
PetPlay.java, and PetPlayMain.java.

2. Run PetPlayMain.java (main class).

3. Click on the pet on the canvas and release the mouse. 
Now the mouse inputs will be tracked (no need for dragging 
just moving).

4. Try to locate the item (looks like a glass cup) on canvas
and move the mouse to collide with it. The item
will be reset to a random position verytime the collision
occurs. 

5. In each collision, the level of madness decreases by 2. 

6. Keep doing the collisions until the level of madness decreases
to zero AND before the timer stops.

7. Once the game stops, reply (y/n) if the player wants to play
another round.
